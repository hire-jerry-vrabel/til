## Context

I have an interview coming up with a healthcare advertising agency.
One of the job responsibilities is "support Veeva implementations and
maintain strong working relationships within the Veeva ecosystem."

I'd never worked directly with Veeva before so I dug in. Here's what
I learned.

## What Veeva Is

Veeva Systems is a vertical SaaS company focused exclusively on the
global life sciences industry. Think of it as the operating system
of the pharmaceutical industry — it powers drug development, clinical
trials, regulatory submissions, and commercial operations for 1,500+
companies including most of the world's largest pharma brands.

## The Product That Matters for Ad Agencies — Vault PromoMats

Every piece of promotional content a pharma company puts into the world —
ads, websites, emails, sales rep presentations — must pass through a
strict approval process before it can be used. That process is called
MLR: Medical, Legal, and Regulatory review.

PromoMats is the Veeva Vault application that manages this workflow.
As an agency developer, everything you build has a compliance dependency:
it doesn't ship until PromoMats says it's approved.

## What MLR Actually Means

Three gates every piece of pharma content must pass:

- **Medical** — is the clinical claim accurate and evidence-based?
- **Legal** — does it expose the company to liability?
- **Regulatory** — does it comply with FDA rules?

This is why pharma advertising moves slower than other industries.
It's not bureaucracy for its own sake — it's legally mandated.

## What Supporting Veeva Means for a Developer

A few concrete things:

**API Integration** — Veeva has an Open API. You'd build connections
between web deliverables and the client's Vault instance for content
distribution, versioning, and status tracking.

**Compliance-first development** — content can't go live until it's
approved in Vault. Feature flags tied to approval status, content
versions aligned with Vault document versions — these become part of
your architecture.

**Multichannel distribution** — PromoMats supports CLM (sales rep
tablet presentations), Approved Email, and web. Digital experiences
you build plug into this pipeline.

## The Latest Thing Worth Knowing — Veeva AI (Dec 2025)

Veeva just launched AI agents for PromoMats:

- **Quick Check Agent** — scans content against brand, editorial,
  and compliance guidelines BEFORE it enters MLR review
- **Content Agent** — answers questions about documents, summarizes
  content, analyzes visuals

The Quick Check Agent is particularly interesting from a developer
perspective — catching compliance issues before they reach reviewers
means fewer revision cycles and faster time to market.

## Key Terms to Know

| Term | What It Means |
|---|---|
| MLR | Medical, Legal, Regulatory review |
| Vault | Veeva's core platform |
| PromoMats | Vault app for promotional content |
| CLM | Closed Loop Marketing — sales rep tablet presentations |
| HCP | Healthcare Provider — doctors, nurses, prescribers |
| 21 CFR Part 11 | FDA regulation on electronic records and signatures |

## The Takeaway

Veeva isn't just a tool — it's the compliance backbone of pharma
marketing. Understanding it as a developer means building with the
approval workflow in mind from day one, not bolting it on at the end.

That's a mindset shift, not a technology shift. And it's one I'm
ready to make.
